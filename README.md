Be sure to include a readme.md file in your repository so we know how to run your code.

**For most of you, we should just be able to clone or download a zip file of all the files you have on your repository and run them locally.**

**Some of you may choose to publish your site, if you do, please include the link to access that published site here.**

**Some of you may build a more complex site that is not published which would require more setup to get your code to run (example: use of npm install and npm start) so please include any of those details here.**
